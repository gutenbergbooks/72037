<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span>, in 1919, Private John Benton
returned from France, he was not a hero of the proportions
of three or four who, alone and unaided, had slain
six or a dozen of the enemy and captured a hundred; but
he was a warrior not to be sneezed at. He had been
decorated by three nations and kissed by half the women
in Paris, and the welcome given him by natives of his
home town was one that rocked Idaho from end to end.
There were seven speeches and a dozen bands and two
truckloads of flowers, and more flags and friends and
goodwill than John had ever seen before. His mother
sat between two mayors, and his gawky young sister was
deferred to and flattered by all the politicians between
Boise and the Wyoming line.</p>

<p>And it all went to John’s head a little; but he remembered,
even so, that war had been a dark and sightless
butchery, and that German soldiers, hungry for cigarettes
and peace, were human beings much like himself. He
was sick of war and he wanted quiet and forgetfulness.
He was a little terrified by the sadistic ardor of these
homeland patriots who had never seen horror in young
faces or a bayonet in the belly of a man. “We licked
them all right!” cried a neighbor. “Hey, John, didn’t we
whack it to them?” And the man looked at John and
burst with happy, victorious laughter. “The Huns learned
something when the Yanks got over there,” said another.
“By God, don’t tell me they didn’t!” “How was it over
there?” asked a third. “A lot of fun, wasn’t it, now?
Hey, John, you lucky devil!” And to all this, John’s
answer was a pitying shrug and a wan smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p>His smile became almost ghastly as he listened to the
principal speaker. The man shouted in furious rhetoric
and aroused the great audience to wild and prolonged
applause. “We have with us today one of the mightiest
heroes in that great struggle to make all nations and all
peoples the guardians of peace: a native son, one of our
own boys. We have gathered here to honor his name
and to write it high among the selfless knights who march
under the flags of war to make the world safe for the
mothers of men! In profound humility we are gathered
to pay homage to this soldier and patriot, this son of the
Idaho mountains and valleys, who captured, single-handed,
the machine-gun nest of the enemy, and marched
his foes, beaten and vanquished, down the soil of France
where the name of the great Lafayette still rings like a
bell in the hearts of civilized nations!”</p>

<p>And when, after seven speeches and such applause as
he had never dreamed of, John Benton was called to the
flag-draped stand to say a few words to his friends and
neighbors, he went with a sinking heart. He looked at
ten thousand faces, so hushed and listening that he could
hear his own breath; and for so long a moment he was
speechless, staring at the throng, that a voice from far out
yelled: “Atta boy, John! Tell us how you licked the
Huns!” John cleared his voice and a man yelled:
“<em>Louder!</em>” and another shouted: “Atta boy, John!”
“Friends and neighbors,” said John at last, “I am grateful
for this welcome.” A hand clapped and then the great
throng roared with applause that made the rostrum tremble.
A thousand automobile horns picked up the greeting
and rolled it in thunderous volume, and for five minutes
John waited, with the tremendous welcome like madness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
in his ears. “I appreciate your kindness,” said John, when
silence fell again, “and all that you have done for me.
But war, my friends, is not what you seem to think it is.”
He paused and licked his dry lips and the audience
waited. When he spoke again, those sitting close by were
startled by his vehemence. “War, my friends, is murder.
We soldiers learned that the German soldiers were not
our enemy. Maybe it was a good war, fought in a good
cause, and maybe it was not. I don’t know. All I know
is that I’m sick of war and I won’t ever fight in another
war and now I want peace and I want to forget. And—well,
I guess that’s about all I have to say.”</p>

<p>There was no applause now. There was only stunned
silence and then a low murmur that was like that of rage,
gentle and baffled. Private John Benton had spoken
simply from his heart, little suspecting that his words
were to lay waste to his life.</p>

<p>John Benton, son of uneducated farmers, was a senior
in high school when English propaganda drew his country
into war. He was a shy and neurotic young man, deeply
ashamed of his social background and his illiterate relatives.
He was among the first to enlist. He went not as
a patriot but as one without social or cultural anchor and
without friends, who saw in war an opportunity to prove
his courage and his worth. Nobody in his home town had
ever spoken to him, except one barber and the neighboring
farmers whom he met on the streets. And now he
was to be a policeman or a night watchman or assistant
to the sheriff; he was called by his first name; he was
invited into the best homes. And in these first days he
was very happy and loved his townsfolk and began to
fancy himself as a man of national importance. But after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
his brief reply to the great welcome there had been a
sudden and drastic change. When he met the mayor now
or any of the other plump and prosperous men who had
made his homecoming a memorable day, he was acknowledged
with a curt nod or not at all. He got no job of
any kind and he wandered up and down the streets or sat
in pool halls watching the poker chips, feeling a little
vengeful and deeply unhappy, and wondering why he
had become only John Benton of the Benton farm on
Mill Creek.</p>

<p>It was Bill Hawkworth who gave him an idea. Bill was
a lean man with shrewd and cynical eyes and a tubercular
cough. He worked in a pool hall with a cigarette hanging
from his white mouth and a fixed and changeless contempt
in his pale eyes. He sat by John one day and
looked at him with leering pity.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, buddy? Ain’t they treatun you
right any more?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean,” said John, looking at
Bill’s wet dead cigarette.</p>

<p>“Oh, you know, all right. The mayor,” said Bill, and
jerked his sallow head toward city hall. “All them fat
guys, buddy.” He smiled. His upper lip curled and the
hair of his ragged mustache fell like a hedge across his
yellow teeth. “You fanned out quick, didn’t you? Well,
buddy, do you know why?”</p>

<p>John turned a little angrily and looked at the lidless
cynicism of Bill’s eyes. “No,” he said.</p>

<p>“Want me to tell you?”</p>

<p>“Well, sure—if you can.”</p>

<p>“All right, buddy, it’s this way. You come back from
war a big hero and the city gives you a big bust and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
there’s speeches and flags and popcorn for everyone and
they wanted to hear how you licked hell out of them
Huns. And right there’s where you fanned. You come
to bat all right, but you just wouldn’t swing at the ball.”
Bill’s lips curled against his teeth and his eyes flickered.
“You get me?” he said.</p>

<p>“You mean—? No,” said John, “I don’t know what
you mean.”</p>

<p>“I mean you coulda put this town right in your pocket.
You coulda jumped plumb into the middle of society
and married the richest girl around here and had a truckload
of fortune drive right down your alley. But what
did you say when they asked what you thought of the
popcorn?”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you, buddy. You said war is murder. You
said you guessed mebbe the Germans wasn’t your enemy
at all. You said you wouldn’t fight in another war to
please God Almighty hisself. And all them,” said Bill,
curling his lips in cruel mockery, “was a hell of a crack.
Did you think they got all them-there brass bands and
speeches and popcorn trimmings to hear you throw them
Christian sentiments in their teeth? Was they intendun
to make you assistant sheriff if you didn’t like to fight?”
Bill’s smile was evil. “Buddy,” he said, “you fanned.
You swung plumb hard and missed and fell right on your
mug.”</p>

<p>“What did they expect?” asked John, staring, fascinated,
at Bill’s sinister eyes.</p>

<p>“God damn, buddy, that’s a stupid question. They
wanted you to tell how you made them Huns jump back
over the Rhine like a buncha frogs—.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span></p>

<p>“But I didn’t,” John said.</p>

<p>“Oh, the jumped-up holy ghost!” Bill drew the weak
muscles of his face down until his upper lip lay across his
lower teeth. He smiled with mirthless cunning and looked
at John with gentle pitying amazement. “Buddy, you
wanta know how to be a hero again? I’ll tell you. You
say war’s a swell thing if you’re on the right side—and
you was on the right side, buddy—” Bill’s grin was chilling.
“You tell how you rammed them Huns in their guts
and piled them up in the Rhine until it run backwards.
And if you could tell how you saved a virtuous woman—say,
for the love of virgins, couldn’t you tell a story like
that? Buddy, that would put you right on top of the popcorn
pile with a cigar in your face a yard long. Well,”
he said, and spit straight down between his knees, “you
get the idea.”</p>

<p>But it was a difficult idea for John Benton to grasp. He
walked around like a tall pale ghost of a man, with spiritual
anguish in his thin, sensitive face. He wanted persons
to like him. He wanted persons to remember Jesus,
as he had remembered Him for two years in France, and
to look far into the ways of kindliness and mercy. But
Bill, meeting him now, gave him a cynical yellow smile
and a jab in his ribs. “Be fierce,” he said, smirking wisely,
“and blow your horn.” And again: “Buddy, stop lookun
like one of the twelve apostles, huntun around for the
coast of Galilee. Sail out and tell them-there big stomachs
what they wanta hear.” And John, after days of wretched
indecision, resolved to try.</p>

<p>He approached the matter gently, experimentally, at
first, telling only the less horrifying details of war; and in
the men here who had remained at home he found an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
eager response. They gathered round him in the pool hall,
and when his tale faltered, or when he broke off, feeling
sick and traitorous, they urged him to resume. “Hey, John,
tell us how you captured that there machine-gun nest.”
And simply, without exaggeration, John told of the lone
exploit for which he had been decorated by three nations.
He said he crept out at daybreak and came to the nest
and surprised the gunners and marched them back to the
American line. Such a bald narrative, he learned after
a while, would not do at all. His listeners wanted heroics
and a breath-taking clash and a picture of a lone American
fighting hand to hand with a dozen of the enemy and
licking the whole lot of them. It took John a long time
and many tellings to learn what was wanted. The questions
helped. “And didn’t them cowards put up no fight
at all?” “Hey, John, you don’t mean they just laid down
like a bunch of sheep!” No, John perceived, he could
not afford to mean anything like that. “You’re too modest,”
they said, never doubting that he had more amazing
things to tell; and with increasing recklessness John became
less modest. He elaborated the tale, adding to it in every
recital some breathless episode, some additional moment
in which he missed death by a hair, some new cunning
ferocity in the foe. And he was a strange person, this
tall, grave man, telling his legends and feeling sickened
by the telling.</p>

<p>After a while his tale was a gorgeous thing and not
like the real experience at all. But that, he began to
understand, did not matter. Now he crawled forth under
a red sheet of artillery fire with shells bursting like automobile
motors all around him and with the sky above him
like a rolling mountain of flame. He crawled inch by inch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
through great shell-holes, and the lead falling around him
threw earth into his eyes and stung his flesh like hornets
and dug graves across his path. He crept past dead
bodies—American bodies, the slain and mangled of his
own company, all of them gutted in the gray wet dawn;
went slowly, patiently, toward that one infernal nest that
was raining death on the American line; dragged himself
foot by foot, seeing that one gun belching its flame and
hearing above and around him the mad thundering nightmare
and smelling dead flesh. Inch by inch he crawled
toward that nest, his hair matted with earth, his paralyzed
hands grasping his pistols, his ears running blood—inch
by inch, until at last he was under the red fire of it; and
for a moment he rested, with his senses reeling and his
heart in his throat....</p>

<p>“And—and then?” gasped one.</p>

<p>Then he crept slowly around the bushes of the nest and
forward in the darkness of underbrush until he could
almost touch the five men there, every one of them like
a blackened sweating devil, pouring lead at the American
flag. And here in his narrative John paused, having
learned much of the proper telling of a story; looked at
the choked, almost anguished, suspense in the faces around
him. “Then what?” asked one in a whisper. Then, John
said, carefully building his legend, he examined his pistols
and cocked them; and when all five men were busy, working
like fiends out of hell, he sprang to his feet and covered
the distance in one bound; brought his guns crashing upon
the skulls of two of them; kicked a third in his belly and
sent him over the machine-gun; and jammed the pistol
barrels into the bellies of the fourth and fifth. The third,
knocked into the line of fire, was slain by his own gun,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
and the first and second rose, with blood gushing from
their skulls, and reached for the sky. He marched the
four of them, gory with wounds, out across the surging
hell of no-man’s-land, and that was the end of a nest that
had taken thousands of American lives. It was the end,
John learned to understand, of the most villainous bandits
on the whole western front....</p>

<p>The news of John spread, and three months after his
return the local paper announced:</p>
<br>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center no-indent">JOHN BENTON TO SPEAK</p>

<p class="fs80">John Benton, one of the greatest heroes in the World
War, and Idaho’s native son and our own fellow-townsman,
will address a mammoth meeting tonight in the
Paramount Theater and relate some of his most dramatic
experiences. He will tell of his capture, alone and unaided
and in a veritable deluge of bursting shellfire, of
the most murderous and treacherous machine-gun nest
on the whole German front.</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>And John did. The audience went wild with applause
and he was again a hero. On the following Sunday he
had dinner at the mayor’s home and repeated his story
to nine distinguished guests; and when one of them, Harry
Cuthwright, a banker, declared that Germany was a
degenerate nation and that America had entered the war
with the noblest of motives, John hastily agreed. Within
a month he was the most respected person in his home
city. The girls looked at him with coy admiration and
the men deferred to him when he spoke. Though happy
and proud, he was troubled, too: he no longer knew what
the truth was or was not, and with obstinate ardor he
strove not to care. And he blundered again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>If he had been modest, reciting his legends only after
repeated urging; if he had understood why the persons
here wanted his legends and how fickle their worship was,
he might not have become the pest that he was to be a
few years later. But the more he realized that interest in
him was waning, the more he was whetted to invest fresh
details and to tell his bloody fables to those who no longer
cared to listen. After a while he insisted on telling them
to persons who were bored and impatient; and as his
nation was restored, year by year, to prosperity and interest
in disarmament and world courts, John’s power diminished,
his exploits were forgotten, and he himself became
a pale and humorless nuisance. He did not understand
that a revulsion against war had overtaken his country.
When persons tried to shrug him into silence, or told him,
with a contemptuous grimace, that he was a bad citizen,
he became comically aggressive in his bearing and blasphemous
in his speech. He said there should be another
war—with Japan, perhaps—and declared that he would
be the first to enlist. He swaggered and got into drunken
brawls, and twice for disturbing the peace was thrown
into jail.</p>

<p>“You’re a bad citizen,” said Cuthwright, the banker.
“The United States has always been a peace-loving nation.
We were dragged into that last damned war by a
cowardly President who promised to keep us out of it.
And now look at our war debts!”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said John. “Why don’t we go over with an
army and collect them?”</p>

<p>“Collect hell! Keep out of Europe, that’s what I say.
That’s what Washington said. It’s men like you, Benton,
who get nations into war. You enlisted in that last one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
and you came back boasting of the men you’d killed and
you’ve been boasting ever since. Why don’t you preach
peace?”</p>

<p>“Peace!” said John, appalled.</p>

<p>“Yes, peace. Didn’t Jesus command us to seek peace?
But you go around with your damned doctrines of
hatred—”</p>

<p>“Preach peace!” cried John, aghast.</p>

<p>“Listen, Benton, you sound just like Mussolini to me.
Why the hell don’t you go over to Italy? Anyway, we’re
a peace-loving nation, and I’m telling you, Benton, you’d
better change your tune. This city is getting awfully sick
of you.”</p>

<p>Cuthwright was the greatest man in the city and his
rebuke threw John into a terrific struggle. He felt angry
and baffled and lost. He went to his father’s farm and
sulked there, and then went to church and listened with
doubtful ears to a plea for internationalism and the World
Court. He wanted to rise and blaspheme the preacher;
but he learned, after his sulking was done, that he had
kept all the while, overgrown with boasting and anecdote,
a belief in peace: it was there, under the fierce thicket
of his words and gestures, and it came little by little like
a thing out of hiding. And he wept one day in bitter
astonishment and then felt a new and frenzied eagerness,
as if he had come out of darkness, a vault, to look at a
clear sky. He returned to the city and the first to greet
him said:</p>

<p>“Well, how’s the braggart today? Hey, how’s your
one-man war against Germany?” And another said:</p>

<p>“Hello, John. You still capturing that machine-gun
nest?” And John looked at them with strange, unhappy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
eyes. He went away from them without speaking and
entered a pool hall and saw the winks and leers. He sat
and read a newspaper or looked at the men, thoughtfully,
gravely, wondering about them and about himself. A
slender, fair-haired youth came up and sat by him.</p>

<p>“John,” he said, “just between me and you, isn’t war
plain damned murder?” John hesitated. He looked at
the clear blue eyes, candid and friendly. “You said so,
years ago,” the young man went on. “I was just a kid
then. I heard you. I’ve never forgotten it. And Professor
Jameson heard you, too.”</p>

<p>“Who is Professor Jameson?”</p>

<p>“He teaches in the college here. He would like to meet
you.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked John, feeling a little sick.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. He—he hates war. And he says
you did—once.”</p>

<p>John was thoughtful for a long moment. “Yes,” he
said, looking at the young man with eyes full of memory,
“I—I did.” He turned away, full of bitter loneliness
and grief.</p>

<p>It was Arnold Jameson who set John on his feet again.
Jameson was a small unobtrusive man with large tragic
eyes. He was gentle and kind, and he had John over to
dinner; after dinner he said:</p>

<p>“I suppose you know Jim Harlan died last week. And
Walt Ainsworth last summer. Both from old wounds.
And Dick Roscoe hasn’t more than two or three years
to go. But the world is shaping up toward peace now,
Benton, and I’ve often wondered why you don’t take a
hand in it.” John was silent and ashamed, remembering
how he had boasted of medals and brawls and told of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
legendary Germans whom he had run through with a
bayonet. “In 1917 I opposed the war,” Jameson went on,
“and nearly lost my job. But now we can teach peace
and get away with it.” He looked at John’s sensitive,
unhappy face and wondered about him. “Seven years
ago,” he said, “you believed in peace. What changed
you?”</p>

<p>“I—I don’t know,” John said.</p>

<p>“I’ve some books here,” Jameson said, “that I thought
you might like to read.”</p>

<p>Deeply ashamed, and no longer the town’s worst
drunkard and braggart, John settled down and married a
blue-eyed girl and lived in a tiny house on a quiet street.
He talked often with Jameson and visited his classes in
the college and became an ardent apostle of internationalism
and goodwill. He rejoined the church from which
war and bitterness had divorced him; taught a group of
boys in Sunday school; and became a speaker in demand
throughout the countryside. He was again a hero and
his heart was in his work. “There is no need,” said those
who introduced him, “to tell you who John Benton is.
His devotion to peace shows that the last war was not
fought in vain. It is with pride.”... And it was with pride
that John faced these audiences on Washington’s or
Lincoln’s birthday or on Armistice Day and spoke out of
his heart. It was with pride that he became Jameson’s
closest friend and heard Jameson say: “It’s on the few of
us, John, that civilization depends. We must keep our
heads when the world goes mad.” John was keeping his
head. In the tenth year after his return and in the thirty-second
of his life he was elected a trustee of the college.
He was a person of power in his community.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>“John,” said Cuthwright one day, “we’re proud of you.
I knew you’d come to your senses.”</p>

<p>“It took me a long time,” John said.</p>

<p>“Yes, but oaks don’t grow in a season.” Cuthwright
laid a friendly hand on John’s shoulder. “I lost a son
in France,” he said, his eyes misty. “But now—well,
that was the price we paid, John, for a better world.”</p>

<p>No one knew less certainly than John himself how it
came or what it meant. There was at first, of course, a
crashing of industrial pyramids, and then the depression,
but everyone spoke of it lightly and said it would soon
pass. It did not soon pass, and there was growing anxiety
and unrest. There were farmers who had been earnest
citizens; but now, with their taxes unpaid, their homes
mortgaged, many of them became bootleggers and drunkards.
There were small business men who had gone into
bankruptcy; doctors and dentists with unpaid bills piling
up on their desks; common laborers who, unable to find
work, loafed in the pool halls and became brutal and
cynical. Then there was a new President and, for a little
while, new hope; but when the chief bank here failed to
open its doors there were angry threats and almost a riot.
It was learned that Cuthwright and all the chief stockholders
had withdrawn their money long ago.</p>

<p>Then matters in Germany came to a crisis; the words
of the Italian war lord stood in black type across the newspapers;
and Japan was invading China. After a while,
some persons here began to talk of the next war and they
spoke with such hopeless resignation or with such fierce
impatience that John was alarmed. He redoubled his
efforts for peace. The audiences were small now and
applause often ran into hisses; and then he was no longer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
asked to speak anywhere. Some of his townsfolk began
to look at him with suspicious or hostile eyes.</p>

<p>And the hostility grew. One by one his colleagues fell
away and he and Jameson stood alone. The bishop under
whom he had labored said a war between the United
States and Japan was inevitable and declared that all the
Japs ought to be driven out of the Idaho beet fields. He
said Japan would conquer China and then come over and
conquer the United States, and his talk excited people
and made them argue for a large army and navy. He
said all aliens should be driven from the nation’s shores.
He said the depression had been caused by the millions
of foreigners here, most of whom were communists and
spies and the scum of earth. He said that any man who
talked of peace when his country was surrounded by
enemies was a communist and a traitor. “And you,” he
said, looking at John with angry eyes, “you’d better watch
your step.”</p>

<p>“I believe in peace,” John said. “And so did Jesus.”</p>

<p>“Our Lord, yes. But what did He know of the menace
of Japs and communists and Fascists?”</p>

<p>And the legend grew. It was rumored that John Benton
and Arnold Jameson were communist agitators. Hadn’t
they defended the Jews? And what were Jews but the
worst damned breed of communist on earth! Didn’t they
think that the confounded Japs should be allowed to thin
Idaho beets, even though Idahoans starved? If they
weren’t communists, then what in hell were they?</p>

<p>And John Benton, bewildered, terrified, felt the growth
of a mighty unfriendliness. Idlers in pool halls, on the
streets, looked at him with skulking eyes. Men who had
introduced him as our distinguished citizen did not speak<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
to him now. He wrote a letter to his local paper, summarizing
the argument of an eminent American who said
Roosevelt might lead the nation into war to save his face.
And then the crisis came.</p>

<p>The paper declared one morning that Jameson had
made remarks to his classes which were false and subversive
and communistic, and that John Benton was in the
pay of Russia. It demanded the dismissal of the one and
the resignation of the other; and two days later Jameson
was called before the trustees. There were five members
on the board, including John; Cuthwright, the banker; a
druggist; and a lawyer and the editor of the local newspaper.
They sat at the head of a long table in the banker’s
office and Jameson came in, looking anxiously from face
to face. Cuthwright waved him to a chair.</p>

<p>“Jameson, have you anything to say in your defense?”</p>

<p>“What is the charge against me?”</p>

<p>“Why, that your teaching is subversive. It is dangerous
to the welfare of our government.”</p>

<p>“Because I preach peace?”</p>

<p>“Because,” said Cuthwright impatiently, “you talk like
a communist.”</p>

<p>He leaned forward and folded his arms on the table.
He was a big man with stern jaws and a paralyzing gaze.
“A week ago you said in your class in history that the
World War was a mistake and we entered it because our
statesmen were outwitted by the English. You implied,
as I understand it, that we’re a nation of fools—”</p>

<p>“I was quoting,” said Jameson, “from a book.”</p>

<p>“What book?”</p>

<p>“A book by Walter Millis called <cite>The Road to War</cite>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, and what in hell does he know about it? Who
is he—a communist?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you don’t think so. Jameson, I should say that
before you try to instruct the minds of our sons and daughters
you’d find out who an author is. He may be only
a paid agent of Stalin. Besides that, you said all wars
have been stupid.” Cuthwright looked at his notes. “You
said England and the United States don’t intend to let
Japan dominate the East. Why in hell,” demanded
Cuthwright angrily, “shouldn’t <em>we</em> dominate the East?
You mean to tell me you’d let a bunch of Japs do it?”
Cuthwright thumped the table. “And you said the
United States should boycott Italy if it invades Ethiopia.
What in hell is it our business if they go down and fight
those niggers? And where are we to sell our goods if you
communists close up all the foreign markets? I suppose
you’d let England sell guns and stack ours up in the
Metropolitan Museum! Well, do you deny any of those
statements?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“All right, Jameson, we’ll have to ask for your resignation.”</p>

<p>Jameson was very pale now but his gaze was unwavering.
“For more than twenty years I’ve lived here and
taught here.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know, Jameson. We’re sorry about it. But
our duty—what you don’t understand, Jameson, is that
the welfare of the State is greater than that of any individual.
You didn’t use to be a communist.”</p>

<p>“And I’m not one now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>“Well, any man can hide behind a definition. Anyway....”</p>

<p>John Benton wondered afterwards why he did not
speak up in defense of his colleague. “I’m a coward,”
he told his wife. He paced the room, agitated. “I’m a
coward!” he cried. “I can see it now!” And a week
later, when the local paper again called him a communist
and demanded in a long editorial that he resign from the
board, he shook all over. He felt the nameless dread of
his youth. And when his fellow trustees called him into
conference behind a locked door, he trembled with anxiety
and turned to them a face as white as death. They asked
for his resignation. They asked if he had anything to say.
He looked at them and every one of them, it seemed to
him, was a man at ease, plump, secure, certain. He rose
to his feet. “Yes,” he said, his voice shaking, “I have
something to say. It’s perhaps the last thing I’ll ever say.
Yes, I want to say that I fought in the last war. I know
a lot of men who fought in the last war. Where are
they? Dead—like Harlan and Roscoe and Ainsworth.”
He licked his dry lips. He placed hands on a table to
steady his shaking frame. “But you didn’t fight in that
war. Did you?—did you?—or you? No, you’re Goddamned
right you didn’t! But I did. And I was not a
coward, either!” His voice was a little wild now. “I was
decorated for bravery, wasn’t I? Wasn’t I?” he demanded,
with humorless tragic pride. “And I came back and hated
war and I spoke against war, and what did you do to me?
What did this town do to me? I’ll tell you: it made a
street bum out of me. You did! You’re liars if you say
you didn’t. A street bum—a drunkard—a fool, because
I hated war and spoke against war. And then,” he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
his face awful in its white anguish, “then I favored war,
I did, and—and you turned against me again. I couldn’t
please you,” he said, with dry choked bitterness. “Just
like Jameson couldn’t—nobody can, nobody! Nobody,”
he said. “And then—then I preached peace and you
liked me and I had friends and I liked to preach peace
and I was happy. I had friends. Everyone was my
friend: you—and you. Everyone,” he said, proudly.
“Everyone. But now—now nobody speaks to me and
they call me a communist, and I’m not a communist, but
nobody can please you. I can’t, Jameson couldn’t, nobody
could.” His voice fell almost to a whisper, anguished and
tragic and hopeless. “I fought in that war and I was
decorated for bravery and I’ve tried to make everyone like
me. But nobody can please men like you! You don’t
want war and you don’t want peace and—nobody!” he
cried, wildly. His mind darkened and there was something
terrible in his eyes now. He advanced a little, his body
shaking. “I—you—” he said. The muscles in one cheek
twitched. “I fought in that war and I was decorated!”
He leaned forward, searching their faces with dark and
unreasoning eyes, searching for friendliness and goodwill.
“Three nations decorated me for bravery,” he said. He
hesitated, groping, lost. Then he smiled and his smile was
more chilling than his words. “I—” He stopped, trying
to understand. “I’d fight again,” he said, softly, terribly.
He laughed, and the trustees rose and backed away from
him. “I’d fight again,” he said, softly, terribly, advancing
toward them. “Honest!” he declared, clenching his lean
hands. The knuckles on his hands were as white as his
mouth. “I’d fight again,” he said.
